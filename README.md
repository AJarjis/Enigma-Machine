# Enigma-Machine
An emulation of an enigma machine I created during my foundation year at university.

Allows user to enter a message and decipher a message as long as parameters for settings are the same.
Only capital letters, spaces, periods, commas and backslashes are allowed.

Feel free to mess around with.
